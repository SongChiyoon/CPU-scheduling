cpu scheduling simulator
## Write a C-program to implement a simulator with various CPU scheduling algorithms
1. First Come First Serve (FCFS)
2. Round Robin (RR)
3. Preemptive Priority Scheduling with Aging

## User Input
> format : pid, priority, arrival_time, burst_time
> 1. pid : unique numeric process ID (1 to 10)
> 2. priority : an integer value
> 3. arrival_time : the time when the task arrives in the unit of milliseconds
> 4. burst_time : the CPU time requested by a task, in the unit of milliseconds

## Ouput
> Print time-flow (like Gantt chart) and statistical information for each algorithm<br>
> result : output.txt
